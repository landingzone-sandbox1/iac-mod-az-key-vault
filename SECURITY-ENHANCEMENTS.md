# Security Enhancements

## Critical Security Issue Resolved

✅ **Fixed**: `azure-keyvault-specify-network-acl` (CRITICAL)

### What was the issue?
The Key Vault module was not enforcing network access control lists (ACLs) by default, allowing unrestricted access to the Key Vault from any network location.

### How was it fixed?

1. **Always Apply Network ACLs**: The module now always applies network ACLs to every Key Vault, even when not explicitly configured.

2. **Secure Defaults**: When network ACLs are not specified, the module applies these secure defaults:
   - `bypass = "AzureServices"` - Allow Azure services to access the vault
   - `default_action = "Deny"` - Deny all other access by default
   - `ip_rules = []` - No IP addresses allowed (must be explicitly configured)
   - `virtual_network_subnet_ids = []` - No VNet subnets allowed (must be explicitly configured)

3. **Updated Example Configuration**: The `example.auto.tfvars` file now demonstrates secure network ACL configuration with proper documentation.

### Security Benefits

- **Zero Trust Network Access**: All access is denied by default unless explicitly allowed
- **Compliance**: Meets security scanning requirements (tfsec, Azure Security Center)
- **Explicit Access Control**: Forces users to consciously decide what access to allow
- **Azure Service Integration**: Still allows legitimate Azure services to access the vault

### Migration Impact

**Existing Deployments**: If you have existing Key Vaults without network ACLs, applying this update will:
- Add network ACLs with `default_action = "Deny"`
- **IMPORTANT**: This may block current access patterns
- You must add your IP addresses/subnets to `ip_rules` or `virtual_network_subnet_ids`

**New Deployments**: All new Key Vaults will have secure network ACLs by default.

### Configuration Examples

**Allow specific IP addresses:**
```hcl
network_acls = {
  bypass         = "AzureServices"
  default_action = "Deny"
  ip_rules       = ["203.0.113.0/24", "198.51.100.50/32"]
}
```

**Allow VNet subnets:**
```hcl
network_acls = {
  bypass                     = "AzureServices"  
  default_action             = "Deny"
  virtual_network_subnet_ids = ["/subscriptions/.../subnets/web-tier"]
}
```

**More permissive (not recommended for production):**
```hcl
network_acls = {
  bypass         = "AzureServices"
  default_action = "Allow"  # Only use for development/testing
}
```

## Compliance Status

- ✅ **tfsec**: No critical, high, medium, or low issues
- ✅ **Azure Security Baseline**: Network access controls enforced
- ✅ **CIS Controls**: Least-privilege network access implemented
- ✅ **NIST**: Defense-in-depth network security applied
